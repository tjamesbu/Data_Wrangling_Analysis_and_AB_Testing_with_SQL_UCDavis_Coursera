--Use the https://thumbtack.github.io/abba/demo/abba.html to compute the lifts in metrics and the p-values for the binary metrics ( 30 day order binary and 30 day view binary) using a interval 95% confidence. 

  
--For orders_bin: lift is -15% – 11% (-2.2%) and pval is 0.74
--For views_bin: lift is and pval is -2.1% – 5.9% (1.9%) and pval is 0.36
--Therefore for item_test_2, there was no significant difference in either the number of views or the number of orders between control and experiment
